# Hate Speech Classification
[![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/soumyaprabhamaiti/hate_speech_classifier)

A project to classify the input text as hate speech or not using an LSTM model trained on the [Hate Speech and Offensive Language dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset) and [Twitter hate speech](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vkrahul/twitter-hate-speech) dataset from Kaggle.

## Demo
The deployed version of this project can be accessed at [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/soumyaprabhamaiti/hate_speech_classifier). A demo of the app is shown below:

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a combination of the [Hate Speech and Offensive Language dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset) and [Twitter hate speech](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vkrahul/twitter-hate-speech) dataset. The combined dataset contains 56,745 tweets belonging to 3 classes: hate speech, offensive language, and neither, among which the first two are merged to form the final hate speech class. The modified dataset thus formed is an almost balanced dataset with 2 classes - hate speech and not a hate speech. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% validation sets.

## Model Architecture

The model used in this project is a simple LSTM model with an embedding layer, a dropout layer and a dense layer.

The detailed architecture of the model used in this project is shown below:
